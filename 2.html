        The <strong><u>Zerg Swarm</u></strong> is a terrifying and ruthless amalgamation of biologically advanced, arthropodal species of xenomorphic "hyper-evolutionary" superorganisms; they are the overriding antagonists for much of the StarCraft series. Unlike the Protoss and the Terrans, the Zerg are not "tool-makers", lacking technological inclination; instead, they "force-evolve" genetic traits by directed mutation in order to match such technology. Operating as a hive mind-linked "chain of command", the Zerg strive for "genetic perfection" by assimilating the unique genetic code of advanced species deemed "worthy" into their own gene pool, creating numerous variations of specialised strains of Zerg gifted with unique adaptations. Despite being notoriously cunning and ruthlessly efficient, the majority of Zerg species have low intelligence, becoming mindless beasts if not connected to a "hive-cluster" or a "command entity".

        As with the other two primary races, the Zerg are the subject of a full single-player campaign in each of the series' real-time strategy video games. Zerg units are designed to be cost-efficient and fast to produce, encouraging players to overwhelm their opponents with sheer numerical advantage. Since the release of StarCraft, the Zerg have become a video gaming icon, described by PC Gamer UK as "the best race in strategy history".[37] The term "Zerg Rush" or "zerging" has entered video gaming lexicon to describe sacrificing economic development in favour of using many low-cost fast/weak units to rush and overwhelm an enemy by attrition or sheer numbers.[38] The tactic is infamous; most experienced real-time strategy players are familiar with the tactic in one form or another.
