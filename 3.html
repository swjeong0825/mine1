        The <strong><u>Protoss</u></strong>> are a sapient humanoid species in the StarCraft series, originating from Aiur, a jungle planet on the fringe of the galaxy. They were once largely tribal, though four societies now dominate: the conservative Khalai Protoss, the exiled Nerazim, the abandoned Purifiers, and the sadistic Tal'darim. The Protoss are depicted as a physically large and strong species with natural psionic affinities. Their technology is the most advanced of any race depicted in the series, designed to complement and enhance their psionic mastery, and they are generally characterized by their social and political hierarchies, strict moral codes, and deeply philosophical culture. A full single-player campaign has been dedicated to the Protoss in each StarCraft installment to date.
