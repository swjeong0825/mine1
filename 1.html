        The <strong><u>Terrans</u></strong> are a fictional future version of humanity in the StarCraft series. The Terrans are the most splintered of the StarCraft species, consisting of multiple factions and nations that not only fight the other races but each other as well. Considered an adaptive and mobile species "too stubborn or stupid to know when to give up" when faced with existential threat, the Terrans are noted in the lore of the series for their ability to quickly access and drain a planet's resources. The Terrans have been dedicated a full campaign in each real-time strategy video game installment to date, and are defined in-game by their specialization of units and tactics of defense, tanking, mobility, and overwhelming concentrated firepower; they are the only faction to not field any "melee unit". In the series' storyline, the Terrans are usually displayed as being caught in the conflict's crossfire between the Protoss and Zerg; they are forced to fight superior alien powers on two-front war at tremendous technological and evolutionary disadvantage, each determined to destroy the other, while also dealing with frequent internal strife, civil wars and revolutions.
